# 🔥 30 Days of Vanilla JavaScript Projects

Welcome to my 30-day challenge where I build small yet powerful JavaScript projects using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**.

🚀 This repo is dedicated to strengthening my core JavaScript skills by building one project each day — **no frameworks, no libraries!**
