# 🔥 30 Days of Vanilla JavaScript Projects

Welcome to my 30-day challenge where I build small yet powerful JavaScript projects using only **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.

🚀 This repo is meant to improve my core JavaScript skills by building one project each day — no frameworks, no libraries!
