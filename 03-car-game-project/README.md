# 🚗 Malik's Lamborghini Car Animation Game

A creative animation-based game using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, where a **custom Lamborghini** speeds through a visually immersive environment — complete with rotating tires, moving track, background sound, and parallax trees.

---

## 📌 Project Description

This project is an animated car scene built from scratch. I used a **Lamborghini PNG image**, manually **cut out its tires using Photoshop**, and added them separately to animate rotation.

The track, trees, and sky are placed using images layered with **CSS positioning**. Then, CSS animations were used to simulate the car running through the environment.

> 🎯 The only JavaScript part is **background car sound** control logic.

## 🎮 Features

- 🏎️ Lamborghini car with realistic moving tires
- 🌌 Parallax scrolling effect with layered:
  - **Sky**
  - **Trees**
  - **Road track**
- 🎵 Background engine sound using JavaScript
- 🔄 CSS animations for:
  - **Track movement** (to simulate speed)
  - **Wheel rotation**
- 💻 Fully responsive layout (works on mobile too)

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Structure
- **CSS3** – Animations and styling
- **JavaScript** – Background music logic

---

## 🧠 How It Works (Logic Behind the Scene)

1. 🎨 Lamborghini image is placed with `position: absolute`
2. 🛞 Wheels were cut separately using Photoshop, then placed exactly on car wheel spots
3. 🌀 Wheels are animated using `@keyframes rotate` for continuous spinning
4. 🛣️ Track and trees are moved leftwards using CSS animation to simulate speed
5. 🔊 JavaScript adds music play and control for background engine sound

## 🚀 Learning Outcome

- Photoshop + CSS integration in web projects
- Layering and parallax scrolling using CSS
- Mastery of `@keyframes`, `transform`, and `animation`
- Image placement with precision using `position: absolute`
- Audio control using vanilla JavaScript

---

## 🔮 Future Plans

- Add user controls (arrow keys to switch lanes)
- Add obstacles and scoring logic
- Add speed boost or slow-down effects
- Mobile-specific touch gestures for interaction

---

## 🙌 Final Thoughts

This project helped me combine:

- **Design thinking** (Photoshop + layering)
- **Web skills** (HTML/CSS animations)
- **Logic building** (JavaScript sound control)

> 🧭 "Web development is not just about code — it's about creativity, logic, and passion combined."
